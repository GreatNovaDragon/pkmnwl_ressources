## Character Creation

To create a character in this roleplaying system, follow these steps:

1. Wähle ein Pokemon, und kopiere deseen

2. You additionally get a bonus array to apply to your stats attacking and defending stats as you wish:
    - **Generalist**: +1, +1, +0, +0
    - **Specialist**: +2, +0, +0, +0
    - **Expert**: +3, +0, +0, -1
    - **Weak Spot**: +1, +1, +1, -1
    - **Lopsided**: +2, +1, -0, -1
    - **Custom**: Apply bonuses as you wish, ensuring that the total comes to 2, but no bonus actually is higher than 3.

3. Calculate their starting Health Points by adding their Health score
   to 20.

4. Select the Pokémon’s starting Ability, moves from the Conversion
   Sheet, and record them.

5. Assign a Grade of 1 and a Grit of 2 to your character. More details
   about Grade and Grit will be provided in the Playing the Game
   section.

6. Pick a Background


- **Adventurer**: You delve into dungeons without fear, helping others as you go. Take the trait. Start with 15 S, a
  week’s worth of rations, one oran berry, one stun seed, and a trapbust orb. At level 10, advance to *Mercenary*,
  *Rescuer*, or *Folk Hero*.

- **Explorer**: Conquering the untamed wild, you seek out marvellous places. Take the trait Anchor. Start with 10 S, two
  weeks worth of rations, three oran berry, and three escape orbs. At level 10, advance to *Rescuer*, *Detective*, or
  *Dungeoneer*.
- **Researcher**: Time can hide no secrets from you and your thirst for knowledge. Take the trait *Evaluator*. Start
  with 10 S, a week’s worth of rations, two oran berries, two heal seeds and a scanner orb.At level 10, advance to
  *Detective*, *Mythbound*, or *Archaeologist*.
- **Prodigy**: You have been gifted with unique and magnificent talents. Take the trait *Type Advantage Master*. Start

- **Outlaw**: You’re fleeing from your past, one day to face it head on. Take the trait *Actor*. Start with 5 S, three
  days’ worth of rations, two oran berries, a blinker seed, a trawl orb and an escape orb. At level 10, advance to
  *Thief*, *Mercenary*, or *Shadow Blade*.

7. Select one Grade 1 trait

**Character Skills**

Skills represent a number out of 100. To calculate them, roll (3d6) x 5, assigning
the result to whichever skill you like. You may do this six times and fill in the rest
of the skills with a flat ‘15’; this is your base success chance.
When you perform an action, you may be asked to make a skill roll. Roll your
percentile dice – your d10 and d100 – and aim to get below your skill number.
Here are the skills:

- Athletics
- Craft
- Endurance
- Finesse

- Medicine
- Perception
- Performance
- Persuasion

- Specialist Knowledge
- Stealth

# Playing the Game

To play Pokémon Wild Life, you will require a variety of dice. The most
common dice used for resolving conflict and checks are two 6-sided dice
(henceforth referred to as 2D6)

## Combat in Pokémon Wild Life

To play Pokémon Wild Life, you will require a variety of dice. The most
common dice used for resolving conflict and checks are two 6-sided dice
(henceforth referred to as 2D6).

In Pokémon Wild Life, combat is structured into Rounds and Turns. A
Round concludes when every participating Pokémon has taken their turn.

Each Pokémon has three actions available during a single turn, but only
one of these actions can be repeated at the expense of the others.

- **Combat Actions:** A Pokémon may perform only one Combat Action per
  turn, unless instructed otherwise. To execute a combat action, specify
  the Physical or Special move you intend to use, roll 2D6, and add the
  relevant Attack stat. A successful attack is determined by surpassing
  or equaling the opponent's relevant Defense score plus 2D6.

- **Utility Actions:** One Utility Action is allowed per turn, unless
  specified otherwise. To initiate a Utility action, declare the Status
  Move you wish to use. Most Status Moves take effect without the need
  for resolution.

- **Move Actions:** Pokémon can take up to 3 Move Actions per turn.
  However, any additional Move Actions beyond the first one will prevent
  the Pokémon from performing a Combat Action or Utility Action.
  Movement occurs in 5-foot increments (Squares), matching the number
  specified by the Pokémon’s Speed stat.

At the end of a round, if a Pokémon is afflicted by a negative status
condition, they may attempt to recover from it. This is done by rolling
2D6 individually for each Status effect. Keep in mind that only one
Status effect can be rolled to recover from at a time. This mechanic
adds an element of strategy and decision-making to the flow of combat.

### Trigger & Saves

Certain moves come with two key components: Trigger effects and Save
effects.

- **Trigger Effects:** When a move lists a Trigger effect, you roll 1d6.
  If your roll matches or exceeds the specified target number, the
  effect is activated.

- **Save Effects:** Save effects relate to detrimental status conditions
  that can afflict your Pokémon. At the end of a round, you have the
  opportunity to roll to recover from these negative effects.

    - To attempt recovery, you roll 2d6. If you choose to empower your
      save roll, you roll 2d8 instead.

    - Success in rolling a number equal to or higher than the provided
      target number results in the removal of the negative effect.

    - Importantly, you are limited to rolling for the removal of just one
      negative status per round. This mechanic adds a strategic element to
      managing and recovering from status conditions during battles.

### Combat Tactics and Environment

- **Threatened Area and Attacks of Opportunity:** A five-foot radius
  surrounding a Pokémon is that Pokémon’s Threatened Area. If a Pokémon
  is within the Threatened Area of another Pokémon and attempts to
  leave, the Foe may use an attack of opportunity.

- **Cover:** Cover is provided by solid objects that stand between you
  and your target. Trees, walls, and boulders are all common examples of
  cover. A creature must be behind such an obstacle so that at least
  half of its body is protected to claim the benefit of cover. While a
  Pokémon has cover, it gains +1 bonus to both defense scores.

- **Attacking an Unseen Target:** When you attack an unseen target, you
  are guessing where it is. If your guess is wrong, even a successful
  attack roll misses. Alternatively, your Pokémon can use a utility
  action to search for the hidden foe. This usually involves a
  Perception check against the foe's Guile check, with a +2 bonus if
  your Pokémon has special moves like Foresight or Odor Sleuth. If your
  check is higher, you can attack without penalties.

### Combat Mechanics

- **Critical Hits:** A critical hit occurs when your attack roll results
  in an 11 (before bonuses) for the attack or special attack. When this
  happens, you roll the dice again for that attack and add the new
  result to the damage total. Only the damage dice are doubled; any
  bonus damage like Brawn, Talent, or affinity bonuses remains
  unchanged.

- **Knock-out and Death:** A Pokémon is considered knocked out when
  their Health Points reach zero. A Pokémon dies when their health score
  reaches a negative of their maximum hit point score.

### Other Combat Actions

- **Assist:** A Pokémon can use a combat action to help another Pokémon
  in need. For instance, helping wake a sleeping Pokémon by jostling
  them awake. Many of these tasks do not usually require a roll,
  however, if the assistance is complex or risky, the DM may decide if a
  check is needed. Usually, a Pokémon must be near another Pokémon to
  assist them.

- **Defend:** A Pokémon may choose to defend instead of attack, gaining
  +2 to both Defense scores until the start of its next turn. It loses
  this bonus if it cannot move, its speed is 0, or it is unable to use
  actions or make withdraw strikes.

- **Grab:** Using a free hand or appendage, a Pokémon may attempt to
  grab another Pokémon no more than one size category higher than
  itself. This involves a contested check, and the outcome may lead to
  actions like Moving a Grabbed Pokémon or Pinning a Grabbed Pokémon.

### Environmental Interactions and Special Actions

- **Hide:** To hide, a Pokémon must be in an area that covers or
  conceals its presence, such as behind tall trees or in a dark alley.
  The creature makes a contested check, Guile check contested by the
  foe’s Perception check if optional skills are in use.

- **Interact with Environment:** Interacting with environment objects,
  such as cutting rope or pulling a convenient lever, can take as little
  as a utility action. The DM decides how long it takes to interact with
  an environment object in actions. If it is too complex an action, the
  DM may rule that it would take more than a round to complete.

- **Knock Down:** A foe that is no larger than one size category above
  your Pokémon can be knocked over. This involves a contested check, and
  if you succeed, the target is knocked prone with associated penalties
  and bonuses to attacks against it.

- **Neutral Attack:** A basic, type less physical attack. It uses the
  Attack stat for accuracy, deals 1d4 points of damage, plus the user’s
  Brawn, and cannot have its damage boosted by Technician.

- **Push:** A Pokémon may attempt to push another away if the target is
  no more than one size category larger than it. This involves a
  contested check, and success results in the target being pushed 5 feet
  away from the user.

- **Use an Item:** A Pokémon may use an item (e.g., eating a healing
  berry) as a utility action.

### Grit

Grit is a valuable resource you can use to gain an advantage in various
situations. When you use Grit as a Utility Action, you can choose from
the following Combat actions:

- **Recover Hit points:** You can heal yourself by an amount equal to
  your Grade multiplied by your Health Score.

- **Brace for Impact:** This action lets you defend against enemy
  attacks, reducing the damage you take by an amount equal to 5 times
  your Grade, applied after damage calculations.

- **Empower an Attack Roll or Check:** This ability can be used both in
  and out of combat. When you empower your Attack Roll, instead of
  rolling 2D6, you roll 2 eight-sided dice for greater accuracy. When
  empowering a check using optional Skills, you roll an additional die
  appropriate for your skill level.

- **Empower Damage:** When dealing damage, roll an additional d6 for
  each Grade you possess.

Grit naturally recovers after you have had 8 hours of rest, making it a
resource you can strategically use to turn the tide in your favor during
battles and challenges.

### Grade, STAB, Advantage, Resistance, Brawn, and Talent

Grade is related to STAB, Type Advantage, and Type Resistance.

- **STAB:** If your Pokémon shares the same type as the attack they are
  using, they deal extra damage equal to their Grade multiplied by

    2.

- **Advantage:** If the Pokémon you are attacking is weak to the type of
  attack you are using, you deal extra damage equal to your Pokémon’s
  grade multiplied by 2, or 4 if it takes 4 times damage.

- **Resistance:** If the Pokémon you are being attacked by is using a
  move whose type you resist, reduce the damage done to you by your
  Grade multiplied by 2, or 4 if you take quarter damage.

- **Brawn and Talent:** These are added to Physical and Special attack
  damage rolls respectively as bonus damage. If Optional Skills are in
  play, Brawn and Talent cannot be increased with stat increases, and
  are instead increased by upgrading a Vigor or Knowledge skill,
  respectively.

### Status Conditions

- **Burn and Poison:** The target suffers damage equal to the affinity
  bonus of the user at the beginning of each Round until they recover
  from it.

- **Binding:** The target takes damage equal to their own affinity bonus
  at the start of each Round and is unable to move until they recover,
  or after 4 turns.

- **Confusion:** The target can only successfully attack on Trigger 3;
  otherwise, they may damage a random ally or themselves.

- **Curse:** The target suffers 8 points of damage at the start of every
  Round.

- **Dazed:** Dazed lasts for one round after it is inflicted. The user
  cannot use Combat actions and has their speed halved.

- **Paralysis:** Paralysis is a severe condition similar to Dazed, but
  more debilitating. It lasts for multiple rounds, rendering the user
  unable to perform Combat actions, and their speed is reduced.

- **Embargo:** The user cannot activate the effects of their held item.

- **Encore:** The user may only use their last used move or their
  Neutral Attack.

- **Heal Block:** The user cannot use any Healing Moves or utilize Grit
  for healing. Go For Broke applies this restriction on players, with
  the exception that it cannot be saved from.

- **Infatuation:** The target may only use an attack on Trigger 3. The
  user can still use Utility actions (unless it is an attack with the
  Swift upgrade) or Movement actions.

## Inventory

A character can carry 20 items, plus their Attack skill. An item slot
can store any number of items depending on the weight category.  
Items are divided into 5 weight categories. One hundred tiny items of
the same type can be stored in a single item slot. Ten small items of
the same type can be stored in a single slot. One regular item can be
stored in one slot. One large item requires two item slots to store. One
heavy item requires four item slots to store.

## **Move Abilities:**

- **Aftermath:** When the foe succeeds in ending the effect triggered by
  this move, it suffers damage equal to your Grade.

- **Chain Reaction:** When this move scores a critical hit, reduce the
  number needed to trigger the technique’s effect by 1.

- **Defiant:** If surrounded, this move’s attack roll is empowered
  without spending Grit.

- **Fulfilling:** When this move is used, either regain hit points equal
  to its Grade or gain a +1 bonus to checks made to end effects during
  this Round.

- **Grounding:** Attacks made using a move with Grounding allow
  Ground-type moves to hit Flying-types.

- **Intense:** This move does an additional +2 damage if your Pokémon is
  Grade 3 or lower; if Grade 4 or higher, it does +3 damage.

- **Invigorating:** Once per round, if this move deals damage, the user
  regains hit points equal to its Grade.

- **Mastery:** If a damage roll with this move would result in the
  minimum amount of damage, reroll, and take the higher result.

- **Precise:** Targets of this move do not gain a bonus from Cover or by
  using the Defend action.

- **Punishing:** When this technique’s damage roll is empowered, it
  deals an additional +1d6 damage.

- **Sinister:** Targets subject to an effect from this move suffer a -1
  penalty to checks made to end it.

- **Staggering:** If the target is vulnerable to this move’s damage
  type, their Brawn and Talent become 0 until their next Turn, and they
  cannot gain bonuses to their Brawn or Talent during this time.

- **Swift:** Spend one Grit: A Physical or Special move with Swift can
  be used as a Utility action, and a Status move with Swift can be used
  as a Move action. This move cannot be used twice in a single turn.

- **Unyielding:** When this move is used, the user cannot be moved from
  its position except by choice until its next turn.

## Seeds

Due to the nature of how the System works, these seeds function
differently from their Mystery Dungeon counterparts.

- **Joy Seeds:** Permanently increases a Pokémon’s Brawn and Talent by 1
  point.

- **Golden Seeds:** Permanently increases a Pokémon’s Grade by 1, this
  allows a Pokémon to achieve Grades higher than

## Destinies

### ARCHAEOLOGIST

> The past hides great secrets. Ancient ruins, fallen cities: to understand pokémon of the present, we must ask the
> echoing remnants of the past.

  secret functions or magical effects cast upon it.

- Ability (Level 20): Seas of Time. Your knowledge about the past eclipses that
  of even the greatest scholars. Once daily you may study an object or place
  and declare a fact of the past to be true. For instance, that an ancient battle
  took place, that the relic would point to a specific legendary pokémon’s
  sleeping place, or that an ancient tool is actually a primitive key. If the Guild
  Master permits, this knowledge is accepted and written into canon.

### DETECTIVE

> Truth can be elusive. It hides in the hearts of pokémon like how treasure hides in the most treacherous dungeons. It
> won’t elude me. Not again.

- Ability (Level 20): Flawless Deduction. If you have at least three pieces of
  evidence, you can accurately deduce facts about your current case. By
  cashing in three pieces of evidence, you can ask the Guild Master one
  question, which they have to answer truthfully. You can perform this action
  as long as you have evidence to spend, and can reasonably argue how each
  item or piece of knowledge would help you glean the answer to your
  question.

  three claims about it, two of which are then written into truth. These may be about
  the pokemon, items, secrets, terrain, reputation, etc. If the Guild Master permits,
  the chosen two facts are written into canon and become true for all future visits.

### FOLK HERO

> The pokémon around me are the real treasure. I’ll cement my name in their memories forever.

You have a need to help others, and tend to do so with flair and *Surmounting Wit*.

Skill Increase: Persuasion or Craft (Any) increases by 10%, to a max of 95%.

Equipment Proficiency: Carpenter’s Tools

  folk tale feats as you use them, for future reference.

### MERCENARY

> With no home, no honour, and nothing to lose, my skills are all I can depend on.

You’re a cut-throat for hire, selling your skills to pave your path in the world. Your
*Desperation* makes you lethal, as well as your legendary *Hunter’s Prowess*.

Skill Increase: Endurance or Stealth increases by 10%, to a max of 95%.
Equipment Proficiency: Trapmaking Tools

- Ability (Level 10): Desperation. Your skills hone as your HP lowers. At 50%
  HP, you gain +1 to both attacking stats. At 25%, you gain +3. If your HP hits
  0, you may continue fighting for 1d4 rounds with a +5 to
  your attacking stats, before falling unconscious for 2d6 hours.

- Ability (Level 20): Hunter’s Prowess. Assign yourself a target that must be
  taken down. You always have an approximate idea of their location, move
  twice as fast directly towards them, deal double damage if they are below
  half HP, and your allies may add your Attack or Sp. Atk as well as their own
  when attacking them. You cannot change targets until they are neutralised,
  and must wait 24 hours before picking a new target.
