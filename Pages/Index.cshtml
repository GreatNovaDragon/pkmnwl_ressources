 <h1 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h1>
 <p>To play Pokémon Wild Life, you will require a variety of dice. The
 most common dice used for resolving conflict and checks are two 6-sided
 dice (henceforth referred to as 2D6)</p>
 <h2 id="combat-in-pokémon-wild-life">Combat in Pokémon Wild Life</h2>
 <p>To play Pokémon Wild Life, you will require a variety of dice. The
 most common dice used for resolving conflict and checks are two 6-sided
 dice (henceforth referred to as 2D6).</p>
 <p>In Pokémon Wild Life, combat is structured into Rounds and Turns. A
 Round concludes when every participating Pokémon has taken their
 turn.</p>
 <p>Each Pokémon has three actions available during a single turn, but
 only one of these actions can be repeated at the expense of the
 others.</p>
 <ul>
 <li><p><strong>Combat Actions:</strong> A Pokémon may perform only one
 Combat Action per turn, unless instructed otherwise. To execute a combat
 action, specify the Physical or Special move you intend to use, roll
 2D6, and add the relevant Attack stat. A successful attack is determined
 by surpassing or equaling the opponent’s relevant Defense score plus
 2D6.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Utility Actions:</strong> One Utility Action is allowed
 per turn, unless specified otherwise. To initiate a Utility action,
 declare the Status Move you wish to use. Most Status Moves take effect
 without the need for resolution.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Move Actions:</strong> Pokémon can take up to 3 Move
 Actions per turn. However, any additional Move Actions beyond the first
 one will prevent the Pokémon from performing a Combat Action or Utility
 Action. Movement occurs in 5-foot increments (Squares), matching the
 number specified by the Pokémon’s Speed stat.</p></li>
 </ul>
 <p>At the end of a round, if a Pokémon is afflicted by a negative status
 condition, they may attempt to recover from it. This is done by rolling
 2D6 individually for each Status effect. Keep in mind that only one
 Status effect can be rolled to recover from at a time. This mechanic
 adds an element of strategy and decision-making to the flow of
 combat.</p>
 <h3 id="trigger-saves">Trigger &amp; Saves</h3>
 <p>Certain moves come with two key components: Trigger effects and Save
 effects.</p>
 <ul>
 <li><p><strong>Trigger Effects:</strong> When a move lists a Trigger
 effect, you roll 1d6. If your roll matches or exceeds the specified
 target number, the effect is activated.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Save Effects:</strong> Save effects relate to detrimental
 status conditions that can afflict your Pokémon. At the end of a round,
 you have the opportunity to roll to recover from these negative
 effects.</p>
 <ul>
 <li><p>To attempt recovery, you roll 2d6. If you choose to empower your
 save roll, you roll 2d8 instead.</p></li>
 <li><p>Success in rolling a number equal to or higher than the provided
 target number results in the removal of the negative effect.</p></li>
 <li><p>Importantly, you are limited to rolling for the removal of just
 one negative status per round. This mechanic adds a strategic element to
 managing and recovering from status conditions during battles.</p></li>
 </ul></li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="combat-tactics-and-environment">Combat Tactics and
 Environment</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><p><strong>Threatened Area and Attacks of Opportunity:</strong> A
 five-foot radius surrounding a Pokémon is that Pokémon’s Threatened
 Area. If a Pokémon is within the Threatened Area of another Pokémon and
 attempts to leave, the Foe may use an attack of opportunity.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Cover:</strong> Cover is provided by solid objects that
 stand between you and your target. Trees, walls, and boulders are all
 common examples of cover. A creature must be behind such an obstacle so
 that at least half of its body is protected to claim the benefit of
 cover. While a Pokémon has cover, it gains +1 bonus to both defense
 scores.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Attacking an Unseen Target:</strong> When you attack an
 unseen target, you are guessing where it is. If your guess is wrong,
 even a successful attack roll misses. Alternatively, your Pokémon can
 use a utility action to search for the hidden foe. This usually involves
 a Perception check against the foe’s Guile check, with a +2 bonus if
 your Pokémon has special moves like Foresight or Odor Sleuth. If your
 check is higher, you can attack without penalties.</p></li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="combat-mechanics">Combat Mechanics</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><p><strong>Critical Hits:</strong> A critical hit occurs when your
 attack roll results in an 11 (before bonuses) for the attack or special
 attack. When this happens, you roll the dice again for that attack and
 add the new result to the damage total. Only the damage dice are
 doubled; any bonus damage like Brawn, Talent, or affinity bonuses
 remains unchanged.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Knock-out and Death:</strong> A Pokémon is considered
 knocked out when their Health Points reach zero. A Pokémon dies when
 their health score reaches a negative of their maximum hit point
 score.</p></li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="other-combat-actions">Other Combat Actions</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><p><strong>Assist:</strong> A Pokémon can use a combat action to
 help another Pokémon in need. For instance, helping wake a sleeping
 Pokémon by jostling them awake. Many of these tasks do not usually
 require a roll, however, if the assistance is complex or risky, the DM
 may decide if a check is needed. Usually, a Pokémon must be near another
 Pokémon to assist them.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Defend:</strong> A Pokémon may choose to defend instead
 of attack, gaining +2 to both Defense scores until the start of its next
 turn. It loses this bonus if it cannot move, its speed is 0, or it is
 unable to use actions or make withdraw strikes.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Grab:</strong> Using a free hand or appendage, a Pokémon
 may attempt to grab another Pokémon no more than one size category
 higher than itself. This involves a contested check, and the outcome may
 lead to actions like Moving a Grabbed Pokémon or Pinning a Grabbed
 Pokémon.</p></li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="environmental-interactions-and-special-actions">Environmental
 Interactions and Special Actions</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><p><strong>Hide:</strong> To hide, a Pokémon must be in an area that
 covers or conceals its presence, such as behind tall trees or in a dark
 alley. The creature makes a contested check, Guile check contested by
 the foe’s Perception check if optional skills are in use.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Interact with Environment:</strong> Interacting with
 environment objects, such as cutting rope or pulling a convenient lever,
 can take as little as a utility action. The DM decides how long it takes
 to interact with an environment object in actions. If it is too complex
 an action, the DM may rule that it would take more than a round to
 complete.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Knock Down:</strong> A foe that is no larger than one
 size category above your Pokémon can be knocked over. This involves a
 contested check, and if you succeed, the target is knocked prone with
 associated penalties and bonuses to attacks against it.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Neutral Attack:</strong> A basic, type less physical
 attack. It uses the Attack stat for accuracy, deals 1d4 points of
 damage, plus the user’s Brawn, and cannot have its damage boosted by
 Technician.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Push:</strong> A Pokémon may attempt to push another away
 if the target is no more than one size category larger than it. This
 involves a contested check, and success results in the target being
 pushed 5 feet away from the user.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Use an Item:</strong> A Pokémon may use an item (e.g.,
 eating a healing berry) as a utility action.</p></li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="grit">Grit</h3>
 <p>Grit is a valuable resource you can use to gain an advantage in
 various situations. When you use Grit as a Utility Action, you can
 choose from the following Combat actions:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><p><strong>Recover Hit points:</strong> You can heal yourself by an
 amount equal to your Grade multiplied by your Health Score.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Brace for Impact:</strong> This action lets you defend
 against enemy attacks, reducing the damage you take by an amount equal
 to 5 times your Grade, applied after damage calculations.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Empower an Attack Roll or Check:</strong> This ability
 can be used both in and out of combat. When you empower your Attack
 Roll, instead of rolling 2D6, you roll 2 eight-sided dice for greater
 accuracy. When empowering a check using optional Skills, you roll an
 additional die appropriate for your skill level.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Empower Damage:</strong> When dealing damage, roll an
 additional d6 for each Grade you possess.</p></li>
 </ul>
 <p>Grit naturally recovers after you have had 8 hours of rest, making it
 a resource you can strategically use to turn the tide in your favor
 during battles and challenges.</p>
 <h3 id="grade-stab-advantage-resistance-brawn-and-talent">Grade, STAB,
 Advantage, Resistance, Brawn, and Talent</h3>
 <p>Grade is related to STAB, Type Advantage, and Type Resistance.</p>
 <ul>
 <li><p><strong>STAB:</strong> If your Pokémon shares the same type as
 the attack they are using, they deal extra damage equal to their Grade
 multiplied by</p>
 <ol start="2" type="1">
 <li></li>
 </ol></li>
 <li><p><strong>Advantage:</strong> If the Pokémon you are attacking is
 weak to the type of attack you are using, you deal extra damage equal to
 your Pokémon’s grade multiplied by 2, or 4 if it takes 4 times
 damage.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> If the Pokémon you are being
 attacked by is using a move whose type you resist, reduce the damage
 done to you by your Grade multiplied by 2, or 4 if you take quarter
 damage.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Brawn and Talent:</strong> These are added to Physical
 and Special attack damage rolls respectively as bonus damage. If
 Optional Skills are in play, Brawn and Talent cannot be increased with
 stat increases, and are instead increased by upgrading a Vigor or
 Knowledge skill, respectively.</p></li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="status-conditions">Status Conditions</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><p><strong>Burn and Poison:</strong> The target suffers damage equal
 to the affinity bonus of the user at the beginning of each Round until
 they recover from it.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Binding:</strong> The target takes damage equal to their
 own affinity bonus at the start of each Round and is unable to move
 until they recover, or after 4 turns.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Confusion:</strong> The target can only successfully
 attack on Trigger 3; otherwise, they may damage a random ally or
 themselves.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Curse:</strong> The target suffers 8 points of damage at
 the start of every Round.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Dazed:</strong> Dazed lasts for one round after it is
 inflicted. The user cannot use Combat actions and has their speed
 halved.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Paralysis:</strong> Paralysis is a severe condition
 similar to Dazed, but more debilitating. It lasts for multiple rounds,
 rendering the user unable to perform Combat actions, and their speed is
 reduced.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Embargo:</strong> The user cannot activate the effects of
 their held item.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Encore:</strong> The user may only use their last used
 move or their Neutral Attack.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Heal Block:</strong> The user cannot use any Healing
 Moves or utilize Grit for healing. Go For Broke applies this restriction
 on players, with the exception that it cannot be saved from.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Infatuation:</strong> The target may only use an attack
 on Trigger 3. The user can still use Utility actions (unless it is an
 attack with the Swift upgrade) or Movement actions.</p></li>
 </ul>
 <h2 id="inventory">Inventory</h2>
 <p>A character can carry 20 items, plus their Attack skill. An item slot
 can store any number of items depending on the weight category.<br />
 Items are divided into 5 weight categories. One hundred tiny items of
 the same type can be stored in a single item slot. Ten small items of
 the same type can be stored in a single slot. One regular item can be
 stored in one slot. One large item requires two item slots to store. One
 heavy item requires four item slots to store.</p>
 <h2 id="optional-skills">Optional Skills</h2>
 <p>Optional skills provide a way to customize your character’s
 abilities, particularly outside of combat scenarios, like social
 interactions or physical challenges. Each Pokémon can allocate up to 8
 points in any one of these skills, but they cannot start with more than
 5 points in a single skill.</p>
 <p>Skills are categorized into four different proficiency levels:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><p><strong>Untrained:</strong> Characters with 0 points in the skill
 cannot use it for skill checks.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Novice:</strong> Characters with less than 5 points in
 the skill roll two 4-sided dice for checks.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Proficient:</strong> Characters with between 5 and 7
 points in the skill roll two 6-sided dice for checks.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Expert:</strong> Characters with 8 points in the skill
 roll two 8-sided dice for checks.</p></li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="interaction-skills">Interaction Skills</h3>
 <p>Interaction skills are closely tied to Attack and Speed
 attributes.</p>
 <ul>
 <li><p><strong>Guile:</strong> Guile revolves around stealth and
 deception, such as sneaking past a guard unnoticed or pickpocketing
 without detection. Guile checks are contested by Perception or Intuition
 checks.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Perception:</strong> Use perception actively to detect
 anything unusual with your senses. When trying to spot a hidden foe, it
 is contested by the opponent’s Guile; otherwise, the DM sets the
 difficulty.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Persuasion:</strong> Persuasion involves convincing
 others to believe or act differently, including Flattery (contested by
 Willpower), Intimidation (contested by Wits), Lying (contested by
 Intuition), or Diplomacy (DM sets the difficulty).</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Wits:</strong> Wits represent quick reactions in
 unpredictable situations, like evading traps or saving allies from
 danger. If reacting to traps or hazards, the DM sets the difficulty,
 while reacting to intimidation or embarrassment attempts is contested
 against the opponent’s Wits check.</p></li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="knowledge-skills">Knowledge Skills</h3>
 <p>Knowledge skills are linked to Special Attack and Special Defense
 attributes.</p>
 <ul>
 <li><p><strong>Education:</strong> Education encompasses knowledge of
 various subjects, such as languages (e.g., Super Mystery Dungeon’s foot
 runes), identifying materials or obscure items, or even learning moves
 from TMs not typically available.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Intuition:</strong> Use Intuition to distinguish truth
 from falsehood, sense motives, or act on instinct. Identifying forgeries
 or disguises is contested by the opponent’s Guile, while detecting lies
 or impostors is contested by an opponent’s Persuasion check.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Proficiency:</strong> Proficiency involves executing a
 trade or talent, like crafting items, farming berries, discerning the
 use of artifacts, or detecting sabotage. The DM sets the difficulty,
 especially for tasks like identifying sabotaged tools contested by the
 saboteur’s Guile check.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Survival:</strong> Survival skills help you navigate
 wilderness hazards and find sustenance. Use it to forage for food and
 materials, contend with natural challenges, and gauge if tools are
 tampered with (contested by Guile).</p></li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="vigor-skills">Vigor Skills</h3>
 <p>Vigor skills relate to Health and Defense attributes.</p>
 <ul>
 <li><p><strong>Athletics:</strong> Athletics allows you to perform
 physical feats, such as pursuing foes, climbing cliffs, leaping gaps, or
 swimming against currents. It is the go-to skill for physical
 prowess.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Fortitude:</strong> Fortitude measures your resilience,
 whether enduring extreme temperatures, surviving without sustenance, or
 resisting illness.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Strength:</strong> Strength demonstrates physical power,
 like lifting heavy objects, carrying comrades, breaking barriers, or
 engaging in strength contests against another Pokémon.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Willpower:</strong> Willpower is all about maintaining
 focus and discipline in challenging situations, resisting temptation,
 psychic control, distractions, or flattery attempts (contested by
 Guile). The DM sets the difficulty for various scenarios where willpower
 comes into play.</p></li>
 </ul>

 pieces of evidence, you can accurately deduce facts about your current
 case. By cashing in three pieces of evidence, you can ask the Guild
